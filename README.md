Elo is one of the largest payment brands in Brazil. They provide restaurant recommendations for a user along with discounts based on the user's credit card provider and restaurant preferences. Elo has built partnerships with various brands to offer promotions and discounts from various merchants to the user. Now, our problem at hand is to find out the loyalty score for each user on the basis of their transactions.
